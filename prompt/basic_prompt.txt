2. Handling Repetitions:
   - If you encounter the same phrase repeated multiple times, keep it only once
   - For lists or enumerations, maintain proper structure without duplications
   - If a sentence or phrase appears more than twice consecutively, it's likely an OCR error - keep it only once

3. Text Flow:
   - Combine broken lines into complete sentences where appropriate
   - Remove unnecessary line breaks within paragraphs

   - Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document
